# MK Faim Wedding Photogaphy
mkfaim.co.uk is a real life project I am currently working on for a wedding photographer. The purpose of this project was to create a responsive website for the photographer so he can showcase his work. 

Although still in development, users can still navigate through the site and view all sections which includes the home, about, gallery, and contact pages.  Users can also make enquiries via a fully functional contact form.
